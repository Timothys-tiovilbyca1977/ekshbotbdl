Dude, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare and what a freaking ride. Like, who even thought Peter Pan could go all dark and twisted? Seriously didn’t see that coming. I’m sitting here trying to wrap my head around it, and it's like, what did I just witness? I mean, Hook was creepy as hell—what's up with that new look? Straight out of someone's worst fears. Peter ain't the innocent kid anymore, just saying.

> But you know, something about it was kinda addicting. I won't lie, halfway through, I was thinking, huh, I might just need to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   all over again just to catch all the crazy I missed. Like, the way they twisted the whole Neverland thing, turning it into this weird, messed-up world—it was wild! Tinkerbell was basically the MVP, though. Love her sass, even when things got all doom and gloom.

I was also thinking, what's even the message here? That growing up is a nightmare or some deep sht like that? I dunno, maybe I'm overthinking it. But dude, this   made Wonderland look like a summer camp. Seriously.

I gotta admit, some parts had me rolling my eyes; they tried so hard with the dramatic bits. Like, we get it, it's dark now. But hey, can’t deny the visuals were kinda stunning in that eerie way. Also, why was that crocodile scene so intense? My heart legit skipped a beat.

Anyway, I should probably crash. But wow, wasn't expecting that at all. We need to chat more about this, after you've seen it—trust me! You'll have opinions, haha. Just text me back anytime.
